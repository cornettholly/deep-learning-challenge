# deep-learning-challenge
Module 21

The purpose of doing this module is to use our skills and dive deeper into learning how to use an already given dataset

Data Set Information:
The data we had for this project came from an organization called Alphabet Soup.  The information on this has 34,000 applications of funds from different companies.  The metdata included the name, application type, afflitation, classification, status, income_amt of each company that has applied for funding.

Analysis:
Pre-processing the data for this project had me determining what the X and Y targets for the model was.  After determing X and Y I had to narrow down the variables in the dataset and remove all the variables that I did not need to make the model more accurate.


Analysis Conclusion:
Looking back on the various things I created and the levels of accuracy, I would state that refining the first optimized model, this will create better results.  

To change the model I would add more hidden layers and change the activiation.  This would create better results in my opinion.
